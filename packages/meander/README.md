# Meander

Meanger manages all the pages not directly related to the web app tool you are building. It is useful for the following:

- User profile management
- Project management (which projects the user has done)
- Information pages (About, Contact, Pricing, etc...)

and soon this will also include Timeline management and project filtering (something along the lines of a "our picks" or "community collective" style of aggregations)
