				The idea was born in 2014 from the concept of mixing and remixing art. Initially it started with sounds but rapidly evolved to another kind of tool. A painting tool made for the internet. In 2016 I quit my job and started to work on what would become Grid Generator. Back then it was still a rough tool to remix sounds with colors and simple visual forms. After going on and off about it I decided to apply to a startup grant from the Portuguese government in 2017. The grant is named <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.iapmei.pt/PRODUTOS-E-SERVICOS/Empreendedorismo-Inovacao/Empreendedorismo/Apoios-e-Incentivos/Startup-Voucher.aspx">StartUp Voucher</a>, and it consists in a small monthly fee to help new ideas mature and become new companies. I applied to it with the idea of developing a tool to draw patterns with grids and shapes. That was when Grid Generator started evolving into what it is today.
